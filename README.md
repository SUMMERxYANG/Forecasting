For a school project, we were asked to forecast passenger arrivals for an airline given a dataset of 30 samples. We were instructed to use a forecasting method not taught in the course, so I took this opportunity to learn the ARIMA model.

When I followed online ML/coding tutorials in the past, I often found that while I was able to learn how to "drive the car", I didn't quite understand how the car works. This time around, I was pleasantly surprised that an annoyingly abstract stats course I was taking had helped me understand the "inner workings of the car". Definitely gained an appreciation for seemingly unnecessarily abstract stats! Notes in Jupyter.
